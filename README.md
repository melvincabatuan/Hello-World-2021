# Hello-World-2021

## Welcome to LBYEC2B (C Programming)

This is another example assignment where we familiarize our Github classroom workflow.

## Task
Write a C program that performs basic arithmetic computations. The tests are currently failing because we're not implementing the functions in 'calculator.cpp'. Implement those basic arithmetic operations to fix the code.

## To do
Edit the calculator.cpp source file to perform basic arithmetic operations. You may run main.cpp to explore your solution.

## Note
Do not modify any files in '_' folder
